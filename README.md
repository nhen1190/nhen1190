- 👋 Hi, I’m @nhen1190
- 👀 I’m interested in further developing my data science skills and landing a job around data analysis.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python. Or rather re-learning to fill in knowledge gaps where information didn't stick during my masters degree.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on group projects where we can help one another learn. Learning without a team is tiresome and boring.
- 📫 You can reach me via email at nhen1190@gmail.com
